## What Is This Repo?

This repository is a submodule for my first year university repository. [Here's a link there if you're lost.](https://github.com/summerysaturn/y1-university) If you've read up on that, then this is the Unity project for the CI410 Assignment 2 Project, based on the Unity 2D Platformer preset.

This submodule follows an issue found at [y1-university's #16](https://github.com/summerysaturn/y1-university/issues/16). Follow that issue for development on this repo. Documentation will be included in the form of a Technical Report.

## Usage

This repo is useable as a Unity project. Simply clone the repo, install Unity `2019.4.20f1` (or similar), then add the project using Unity Hub. You will need to provide a license (free or paid) to work on this project.
